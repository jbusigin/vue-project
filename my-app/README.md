### Summary
Design and implement the frontend side of a driver assignment system using the Vue Javascript framework. The implementation should support user interaction but should not include a backend or requests to other services. The design should support the following user story.


### User Story
Users want to be able to keep track of the person currently driving their tracked vehicles. To support this, users would like the ability to create/update drivers and edit their personal information like name, email, and phone number. They also need to be able to assign these drivers to vehicles and see which drivers are currently driving a vehicle at a glance.
